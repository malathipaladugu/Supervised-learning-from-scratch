 Supervised-learning-from-scratch
 ---------------------------------
Functions for MSE, Normalised MSE, L1, L2 norms, gradient descent for linear regression were developed
The developed functions were tested on a randomly generated data for linear binary classification, binary cross-entropy for logistic regression

The detailed report along with results is attached in the .ipynb file
